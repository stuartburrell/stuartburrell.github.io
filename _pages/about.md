 I am a research scientist with the deep learning team at [Featurespace](https://www.featurespace.com/), Cambridge. Previously, I worked at [Darktrace](https://darktrace.com/research) and was a research fellow at the University of St Andrews, funded by an early career fellowship from the [London Mathematical Society](https://www.lms.ac.uk/) and the [Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research](https://heilbronn.ac.uk/).

I completed a PhD in Mathematics funded by the [Carnegie Trust](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/) with [Prof. Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and [Prof. Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/). I enjoy teaching and received [Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)](https://stuartburrell.github.io/files/cert-afhea.pdf). In 2020, three students kindly nominated me for the 'Best Postgraduate Tutor' university teaching award. I have also designed courses for and worked with [The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org/) and [First Chances Fife](https://www.firstchancesfife.ac.uk/) to promote wider access to higher education in the UK.
