* Throughout my time at the University of St Andrews I have had the opportunity to tutor and guest lecture several modules within the __[School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/maths/)__. I have also taught for the __[Centre for Academic and Professional Development](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/)__ as a Mathematics and Statistics skills tutor.  

* In recognition of my commitment to teaching and professional development, I was made an __[Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)](https://stuartburrell.github.io/files/cert-afhea.pdf)__ in May 2020. For example, I've enjoyed completing two optional 10 credit Master's level teaching modules: __[ID5101: Supporting Student Learning](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/capod/students/pgrs/modulesid50101-2/ID5101%20Handbook%202018-19_without-reading-list.pdf)__ and __[ID5102: Curriculum Design and Assessment](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/capod/students/pgrs/modulesid50101-2/ID5102%20Handbook%202018-19.pdf)__.

* In February 2020, I was kindly nominated by three students for the 'Best Postgraduate Tutor' university teaching award.  

* At a secondary school level, I have designed courses, undergone training and worked with __[The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org/)__ and the __[First Chances Scheme](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/access/projects/first-chances-fife/)__ to promote wider access to higher education in the UK. In my spare time I enjoy coaching tennis and am a __[Level 1 LTA Accredited Tennis Coach](https://www.lta.org.uk/workforce-venues/coach-teach/tennis-coach-accreditation/)__.
