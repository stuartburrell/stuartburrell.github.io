I enjoy coding and work on various projects.

For example, I have made contributions to two GAP packages:  

### [GAP Semigroups package](http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/semigroups.html)  
Implemented methods to decide the order and torsion problems of natural and tropical matrix semigroups.  

### [GAP Digraphs package](http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/digraphs.html)  
Implementated methods for computing simple circuits.

Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/stuartburrell) to see what I've been up to recently.
